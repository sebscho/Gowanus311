# Gowanus311
This project uses NYC 311 data to investigate noise complaints in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn. Using Python to test for unit roots and stationarity, this analysis shows that Gowanus is statistically different from the rest of Brooklyn in Commercial Noise complaints from 2010 - 2017. 

What can this data-driven story tell us how when the neighborhood changed, and what does the trend mean for the future of my favorite Brooklyn neighborhood?
